                              <h1>Course Overview</h1>

                    <p>Data science encapsulates the interdisciplinary activities required to create data-centric products and applications that address specific scientific, socio-political, or business questions. It has drawn tremendous attention from both academia and industry and is making deep inroads in industry, government, health, and journalism.</p>
                    
                    <p>This course focuses on (i) data management systems, (i) exploratory and statistical data analysis, (ii) data and information visualization, and (iv) the presentation and communication of analysis results. It will be centered around case studies drawing extensively from applications, and will yield a publicly-available final project or tutorial that will strengthen course participants' data science portfolios.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The course will primarily consist of sets of self-contained lectures and assignments that leverage real-world data science platforms when needed. As such, there is no assigned textbook, but there will be some recommended ones. Many lectures will come with links to required readings, which should be completed before or after the lecture (as declared), and, when appropriate, a list of links to other web resources.</p>

                    <p>

                    <p><strong><span style="color: red;">Note:</span></strong> <strong>This course outline is tentative and subject to modification to meet the specific needs and requirements of the students and the evolving field of data science.</strong></p>
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                    <p>
                    Students enrolled in the course should be comfortable with programming (for those at UMD, having passed CMSC216 will be good enough!) and be reasonably mathematically mature. The course will heavily utilize the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>  scripting language through <a href="https://colab.google/">Google Colab</a> (or sometimes <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> Notebook if needed), relying on the <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/">Anaconda</a> package manager. Primer lectures on Python for data science will be provided early on, so there's no need to worry if you haven't used Python before. Later lectures will delve into statistics and machine learning, potentially incorporating basic calculus and basic linear algebra. A light mathematical maturity, roughly at the level of a junior CS student, is preferred.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><em>This course is aimed at junior- and senior-level Computer Science majors, but should be accessible to any student of life with some degree of mathematical and statistical maturity, reasonable experience with programming, and an interest in the topic area. If in doubt, e-mail me: fardina@umd.edu!</em></p>

                    <h3>Grading</h3>
<p>There will be five to six assignments, one final project, two written midterm exams, and one final written exams (cumulative).</p> 
<p> Final grades will be calculated as:<br>
   <table class="table table-striped">

 </table>
                    </p> 


                    <h4>Late Policy</h4>
                     <p>Late work gets no credit.</p>
                    <p>However, each student is provided with four 12-hour extensions, called tokens, on homeworks. 
                        Tokens will be automatically applied onto late homeworks. No request is necessary. 
                        </p>
                    <p>See the next section about how to contact us in special circumstances. We aim to help everyone 
                        succeed.
                    </p> 
                    
                    
                    <h3>Communication</h3>
                     <p>We are going to use a combination of in-person office hours and the Piazza forum (<a href="https://piazza.com/umd/spring2024/cmsc320">sign up here</a>) for Q&amp;A. 
                        This means that it's appropriate to use Piazza for asynchronous communication with the course instructors and other students, 
                        and also for short high-bandwidth discussions that could usually take place before/after class. </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that Piazza is not appropriate for things like asking for accommodations or other such issues/concerns.

                <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

                <p>Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. You are allowed to use the Web for reference purposes, but you may not copy code from any website or any other source. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the Office of Student Conduct. Without exception, every case of suspected academic dishonesty will be referred to the Office. If the student is found to be responsible for academic dishonesty, the typical sanction results in a special grade “XF", indicating that the course was failed due to academic dishonesty. More serious instances can result in expulsion from the university. If you have any doubt as to whether an act of yours might constitute academic dishonesty, please contact your TA or the course coordinator. 
                    The University of Maryland, College Park has a nationally recognized Code of Academic Integrity, administered by the Student Honor Council.B This code sets standards for academic integrity at Maryland for all undergraduate and graduate students. As a student, you are responsible for upholding these standards for this course. It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit http://www.shc.umd.edu. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Examples of Academic Integrity Violations:</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The following are examples of academic integrity violations:</p>
                    
                    <p><ul>
                    <li>Hardcoding of results in a project assignment. Hardcoding refers to attempting to make a program appear as if it works correctly (e.g., printing expected results for a test).</li>
                    <li>Using any code available on the internet/web or any other source.</li>
                    <li>Hiring any online service to complete an assignment for you.</li>
                    <li>You may not post the implementation of your assignments, materials related to the class (e.g., project description), or any other material associated with this online course except the final project. Even if the class is over and you have graduated, you may NOT post any material other than what is allowed.</li>
                    <li>Sharing your homework solutions or your “test code" with any student.</li>
                    <li>Looking at or debugging another student’s code.</li>
                    <li>Using online forums to ask for help regarding our assignments.</li>
                </ul> </p>

                <p><strong>AI tool disclosure: </strong>If a student chooses to use an AI tool to assist in any course work (e.g. assignments, programs, projects, reports, etc), they must disclose this information to the instructor. This disclosure should include the name of the AI tool and explain how it was used.</p>
                <p><strong>Consequences for non-compliance:</strong> Failure to adhere to this policy may result in a zero on the particular course work where the AI tool is used.  In addition, the university honor code is applicable here: violation of the honor code and appropriate action will be enforced. </p>

                    <!-- Section heartlessly stolen from Hector Corrada Bravo -->
                    <h3>University Policies and Resources</h3>

                    <p>Policies relevant to Undergraduate Courses are found here: 
                        <a href="http://ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">http://ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html</a>. 
                        Topics that are addressed in these various policies include academic integrity, student and instructor conduct, 
                        accessibility and accommodations, attendance and excused absences, grades and appeals, copyright and intellectual property.  
                        
                    <p><strong>Projects/Labs:</strong>
                    On any graded project or lab, you are NOT allowed to exchange code. We compare each student's code with every other student's 
                    code to check for similarities. Every semester, we catch an embarrassingly high number of students that engage in cheating and 
                    we have to take them to the Honor Council.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>GroupMe/Other Group Chats:</strong>
                    We encourage students to talk about course material and help each other out in group chats. However, this does NOT include graded assignments.
                    
                    There have been a couple instances in the past where students have posted pictures/source files of their code, 
                    or earlier sections have given away exam questions to later sections. Not only did this lower the curve for the 
                    earlier section because the later one will do better, the WHOLE group chat had to pay a visit to the Honor Council. 
                    It was an extremely ugly business. Remember that in a group of 200+, someone or the other will blow the whistle. 
                    If you happen to be an innocent person in an innocent groupchat and someone starts cheating out of the blue, leave it 
                    immediately (and better yet, say you are leaving and say you will report it).</p>

                    <p><strong>Github:</strong>
                    You may post your project code to private Github (or similar service) repos only. As a student, you can make a private repo for free. Just remember that your free premium subscription has an expiration date, and your code becomes public once it expires. The Honor Council can retroactively give an XF (even to students who have already graduated) if your code is then used by another student to cheat. So just be careful. Posting graded code to a public repo will give you a free ticket to the Honor Council(Unless the instructor has given you permission with some strict conditions).

                    <h3>Excused Absences</h3>
                    <p>Missing an exam for reasons such as illness, religious observance, participation in required university activities, or family or personal emergency (such as a serious automobile accident or close relative’s funeral) will be excused so long as the absence is requested in writing at least 2 days in advance and the student includes documentation that shows the absence qualifies as excused; a self-signed note is not sufficient as exams are Major Scheduled Grading Events. For this class, such events are the final project assessment and midterms, which will be due on the dates listed in the schedule above.  The final exam is scheduled according to the University Registrar.</p>
                    
                    <p>For medical absences, you must furnish documentation from the health care professional who treated you. This documentation must verify dates of treatment and indicate the timeframe that the student was unable to meet academic responsibilities. In addition, it must contain the name and phone number of the medical service provider to be used if verification is needed. No diagnostic information will ever be requested. Note that simply being seen by a health care professional does not constitute an excused absence; it must be clear that you were unable to perform your academic duties.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is the University's policy to provide accommodations for students with religious observances conflicting with exams, but it is the your responsibility to inform the instructor in advance of intended religious observances. If you have a conflict with a planned exam, you must inform the instructor prior to the end of the first two weeks of the class.</p>
                    
                    <p>The policies for excused absences do not apply to project assignments. Projects will be assigned with sufficient time to be completed by students who have a reasonable understanding of the necessary material and begin promptly. In cases of extremely serious documented illness of lengthy duration or other protracted, severe emergency situations, the instructor may consider extensions on project assignments, depending upon the specific circumstances.</p>
                    
                    <p>Besides the policies in this syllabus, the University's policies apply during the semester. Various policies that may be relevant appear in the <a href="https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/undergraduate/">Undergraduate Catalog</a>.
                    
                    <p>If you experience difficulty during the semester keeping up with the academic demands of your courses, you may consider contacting the Learning Assistance Service in 2201 Shoemaker Building at (301) 314-7693. Their educational counselors can help with time management issues, reading, note-taking, and exam preparation skills.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Right to Change Information</h3>
                    <p>Although every effort has been made to be complete and accurate, unforeseen circumstances arising during the semester could require the adjustment of any material given here. Consequently, given due notice to students, the instructors reserve the right to change any information on this syllabus or in other course materials. Such changes will be announced and prominently displayed.

                    <h3>Course Evaluations</h3>
                    
                    <p>Course evaluations are important and the department and faculty take student feedback seriously.  Near the end of the semester, students can go to <a href="http://www.courseevalum.umd.edu">http://www.courseevalum.umd.edu</a> to complete their evaluations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Miscellaneous Resources</h3>
                    <p>As we go through the course sometimes I will mention additional resources or next steps. None of this is required for the course, but students have asked for me to keep a record of which texts/websites I mention.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li> <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/">Python for Data Analysis</a> covers some of the same topics that we cover in this class, but in textbook form.</li>
                        <li> <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/">Data Science From Scratch</a> this book is meant to give you a grounding in how some of the statistics and math could be implemented. Mostly, data scientists use off-the-shelf libraries for their mathematical routines/functionality, this books works through how you would implement some of those libraries. The idea is that this might give you a deeper understanding of what is going on. The implementations in this book are not meant to be high-performance, or industrial strength, but illustrative.</li>
                        <li> <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-101-with-python/#3-requests--beautifulsoup">Web Scraping 101</a> is a good overview to how web scraping works.</li>
                    </ul>
                    As additional reading material and for some of the assignments, we will use 'Zybook for CMSC 320: Introduction to Data Science,' which is a digital textbook available for free. Details to access the Zybook will be shared in class later
